      <h1>My personal CSS/SCSS setup</h1>
      <p>
        My scss setup contains a base-size, BS, as general unit. I define 1 BS
        by dividing 100vw with the design-width. Any element attribute using
        this unit will scale according to the screen width.
      </p>

      <h2>The base size unit BS</h2>
      <code>
        $BS: 100vw / 1980;
      </code>
      <p>
        This means 1 BS resembles 1px of the screendesign width, but converted
        to the vw unit. What this allows me to do, is using the exact design
        pixel specification if needed. For example: If we have a screen designed
        on a canvas of 1980px width and there is a block of 600px width in it, i
        use $BS*600. This will be calculated to 100vw/1980*600=30.3030vw. It's
        basically a simple percentage calculation.
      </p>

      <h2>Automated responsiveness</h2>
      <p>
        Furthermore there are a few scss mixins, which automatically adjust the
        BS according to the screen width (which usually is the device width) at
        switchable breakpoints 500, 768, 1024, 1450 and 1980 (design-width). So,
        if there is no mobile design to work with, everything gets scaled down
        keeping the aspect ratio by default. Which is quite neat.
      </p>
      <code>
        $BreakpointXSRelation: 1 / 500 * 1980;<br />
        $XSBS: $BS * $BreakpointXSRelation;
      </code>
      <p>
        First I calculate the factor between the desired breakpoint and the
        screendesign width. In this case the factor between 500 and 1980 is
        3.96. If i now multiply the BS by this factor, every element using BS
        accordingly will be scaled up times 3.96. But this way not just the
        relations between elements won't be lost, even the general appearance of
        the website won't change. Because once the screen width gets down to
        500px, it will be 3.96 times smaller than the screendesign of 1980px.
        But at this point we multiply BS by the same factor 3.96 to even it out.
      </p>

      <h2>BS font-size taking rem into consideration</h2>
      <p>
        The font-size is also managed by a mixin which converts the BS value
        back to px after factoring also the unit rem in. This results in a
        font-size which is respecting the design and accessibility.
      </p>
      <code>
        @mixin bsFontSize($BS, $value) {<br />
        &nbsp;font-size: calc(1rem * #{$RemSizeFactor} + #{$BS} * #{$value} -
        #{$BaseRemSize} * 1px);<br />
        }
      </code>
      <p>
        This might look a bit mind boggling at first glance, but is quite
        simple once you get behind it.
        <ul>
          <li>1rem resembles either the font-size set on the html or body tag or more favourable the default font-size the user's browser has set.</li>
          <li>$RemSizeFactor is based on the fact, that usually the browsers default font-size is set to 16px. The screendesign may has a copy text font-size of 22px. Which means the factor between is (1 / 16 * 22) 1.375.</li>
          <li>$value is the desired font-size.</li>
          <li>$BaseRemSize is the screen designs copy text font-size.</li>
        </ul>
        Let's look at this in a simplified way:
      </p>
      <code>
        font-size: desiredFontSize - designDefaultSizeInPx +
        userDefaultSizeInPx;
      </code>
      <p>
        So basically if the users browser font-size is set to more than the usual 16px, this mixin will add the «more» and respectively would subtract the «less».
      </p>

      <h2>Long story short</h2>
      <p>
        Using this knot of different mixins, functions and variables I am able to create a website quite fast and even have a mobile version, which must be optimized, of course. But a lot of it is already done.
        This whole section block's SCSS incl. responiveness is basically as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        @mixin intro($type: "") {<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;// get Basesize in correct relation to screen and design width<br />
        &nbsp;$BS: getBaseSize($type);<br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;.intro {<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;padding: $BS * 32;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;max-width: $BS * 1200;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 0 auto $BS * 128;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;@include bsFontSize($BS, 22);<br />
        &nbsp;}<br />
        <br />
        }<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        // Add intro<br />
        @include intro();<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        // Add auto styles with breakpoints<br />
        @include breakpoint("MAX") {<br />
        &nbsp;@include intro("MAX");<br />
        }<br />
        <br />
        @include breakpoint("L") {<br />
        &nbsp;@include intro("L");<br />
        }<br />
        <br />
        @include breakpoint("M") {<br />
        &nbsp;@include intro("M");<br />
        }<br />
        <br />
        @include breakpoint("S") {<br />
        &nbsp;@include intro("S");<br />
        }<br />
        <br />
        @include breakpoint("XS") {<br />
        &nbsp;@include intro("XS");<br />
        }
